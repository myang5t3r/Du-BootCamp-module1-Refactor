# <Horiseon Marketing Firm Refactor>

## Description

In this project I learned how to use Sematic HTML elements to clearly define the layout of a webpage. I also learned how to use CSS to style the webpage. I was able to style the webpage with universal selectors, element selectors, class selectors and id selectors. While refactoring the code set, I was able to reduce the CSS file by 77 lines of code without change the core functions of the website.
